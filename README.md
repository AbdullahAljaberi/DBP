# 🛠️ DELTA AL-BATHA TRADING CO. – Official Website

## Description
I developed this site using two languages for **DELTA AL-BATHA TRADING CO.**, a family company that focuses on authentic Nissan automotive parts. We want to allow customers to order car parts online and to give staff members tools to handle inventory and improve their work.

It was the first significant project for me, showing both how far I’ve come technically and personally as a web developer involved in a business.
