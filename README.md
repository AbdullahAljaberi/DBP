# 🛠️ DELTA AL-BATHA TRADING CO. – Official Website

## Description
This is a bilingual website I built for **DELTA AL-BATHA TRADING CO.**, a family-owned business that specializes in genuine Nissan auto parts. The goal is to help customers browse and purchase car parts online, while also providing staff with tools to manage inventory and improve operations.

This was my first major project and represents a personal and technical milestone in applying my web development skills to support a real business.
